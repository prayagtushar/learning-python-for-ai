# AI Engineering Journal

Documenting everything I learn on the way to becoming an AI Product Engineer — the projects I ship, the tools I pick up, and the patterns behind them. Public on purpose: this is the build-in-public trail.

## How this repo is organized

| Folder | What's inside |
|--------|---------------|
| [flagship-projects/](flagship-projects/) | Showcase pages for the **big builds** — each lives in its own repo; here you get a one-page summary + link |
| [projects/](projects/) | **Small builds** with full code in-repo — single-purpose, learning a specific tool or pattern |
| [notes/](notes/) | Concept & tool notes: [python](notes/python/), [dsa](notes/dsa/), [llm-providers](notes/llm-providers/), [web-scraping snippets](notes/web-scraping-snippets/), [retry](notes/retry-mechanism/) |

**Big vs small:** a build lives in its own repo (and gets a pointer page in `flagship-projects/`) once it's multi-module, deployable, or interview-worthy. Otherwise the full code stays in `projects/`.
